        "abstract": "Recent efforts in fake news detection have witnessed a surge of interest in\nusing graph neural networks (GNNs) to exploit rich social context. Existing\nstudies generally leverage fixed graph structures, assuming that the graphs\naccurately represent the related social engagements. However, edge noise\nremains a critical challenge in real-world graphs, as training on suboptimal\nstructures can severely limit the expressiveness of GNNs. Despite initial\nefforts in graph structure learning (GSL), prior works often leverage node\nfeatures to update edge weights, resulting in heavy computational costs that\nhinder the methods' applicability to large-scale social graphs. In this work,\nwe approach the fake news detection problem with a novel aspect of social graph\nrefinement. We find that the degrees of news article nodes exhibit distinctive\npatterns, which are indicative of news veracity. Guided by this, we propose\nDECOR, a novel application of Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodels to the\nfake news detection problem.

Drawing inspiration from the expressive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) \\cite{kipf2017semi,hamilton2017inductive,xu2018how}, a substantial body of research incorporates graphs with rich social context \\cite{min2022divide,nguyen2020fang,shu2019beyond} to encode the news dissemination patterns and user responses. Despite varying choices of feature types and GNN backbones, existing approaches are relatively consistent in the design of social graphs. More specifically, the graphs typically contain social users and news articles, which allow GNNs to leverage the relations between structural patterns and news veracity (e.g., closely connected nodes tend to have similar preferences or veracity-related properties). This facilitates the aggregation and propagation of crowd wisdom among connected articles and users, yielding more accurate predictions. Therefore, existing works typically consider social graphs as a high fidelity representation of the social context, the structure of which is kept unchanged throughout model training. \n\nHowever, we find that \\textit{noisy edges} remain an inevitable challenge for learning on social graphs. A prominent cause is that influential news articles tend to share a large number of common readers (i.e. social users), regardless of their veracity labels. In Figure \\ref{fig:noise-example}, we illustrate one such case via visualizing the adjacency matrix of a graph constructed with news articles, termed as the news engagement graph (detailed formulation relegated to Section \\ref{sec:newsgraph}). Here, the edge weights are positively correlated with the number of common readers, and larger edge weights imply closer connections between news articles. Figure \\ref{fig:noise-example} shows that the largest weights are assigned to the diagonal, and areas representing real news pairs and fake news pairs are also darker. This is expected, given the self-loops and frequent interactions within groups of real news and fake news spreaders. However, the figure also shows scattered dark spots representing noisy edges between real news and fake news. We observe that \\textbf{edge noise is degree-related}, in that large edge weights are often distributed along certain rows and columns.\n\nNoisy edges severely undermine the effectiveness of GNNs, as the message passing mechanism \\cite{gilmer2017neural} propagates noise and contaminates node representations. However, little effort has been made to mitigate this issue in the fake news detection scenario. Despite preliminary efforts of graph structure learning (GSL) methods in denoising edges for real-world graphs (e.g. citation networks) \\cite{dai2022towards,jin2020graph}, existing GSL methods cannot be readily applied to fake news detection, as they generally leverage pairwise node feature similarity to guide edge weight updates. Given the large scale of social graphs, similarity-guided GSL becomes less feasible and raises critical deployment challenges.\n\nIn this work, we investigate the fake news detection problem from a novel aspect of \\textbf{social graph refinement}. Given a set of news articles, we construct and refine a news engagement graph that connects the articles with common readers. Guided by our observation of degree-related edge noise, we explore veracity-related degree patterns on the news readership graph, and make two key findings: \\textit{\\textbf{(1)}} nodes representing fake news and real news exhibit distinctive degree distributions; and \\textit{\\textbf{(2)}} grouping edges by the veracity labels of the articles they connect, different edge groups demonstrate a clear difference regarding the relationship between degrees and the number of common readers. \n\nMotivated by our empirical findings on veracity-related degree and co-engagement patterns, we present \\underline{\\textbf{De}}gree-\\underline{\\textbf{Cor}}rected Social Graph Refinement (DECOR), a novel social graph refinement framework for fake news detection. DECOR is based on a flexible extension of the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel (DCSBM) \\cite{karrer2011stochastic}, a graph generative model that allows us to simultaneously consider the effects of degree and node labels, in a tractable probabilistic manner. DECOR suppresses noise in the news engagement graph by downweighting the noisy edges, specifically via learning a \\textit{social degree correction mask} based on a theoretically motivated likelihood ratio-based statistic under the DCSBM model, with a nonlinear relaxation to improve the flexibility of the model.\nDECOR utilizes the degree correction mask to adjust the edge weights of the news engagement graph, which is then jointly optimized with a GNN-based classifier to predict news veracity. \n\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\n\\begin{itemize} [leftmargin=*]\n\\item \\textbf{Empirical Findings}: We present two novel findings, on how both \\emph{degree} and \\emph{co-engagement} closely relate to news veracity.\n\\item \\textbf{Principled DCSBM-based GSL}: Motivated by our empirical findings, we propose DECOR, a GSL approach for reducing edge noise, based on a theoretically motivated \\emph{likelihood ratio}-based statistic under the DCSBM model, combined with a nonlinear relaxation. \n\\item \\textbf{Efficiency}: Unlike existing GSL approaches, DECOR avoids using high dimensional features as input for GSL, and is also linear in the number of edges, thus being 7.6 - 34.1 times faster than existing GSL approaches.\n\\item \\textbf{Effectiveness}: DECOR improves F1 score by 4.55\\% and 2.51\\% compared to the best baseline on two real-world fake news detection benchmarks, consistently improves the performance of multiple GNN baselines in a plug-and-play manner, and outperforms baselines under label scarcity.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\n\n"

Despite the prior success, extensive studies have demonstrated that GNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks in terms of structural noise \\cite{dai2018adversarial, wang2019attacking,zugner2018adversarial}. To alleviate this issue, numerous works have focused on learning optimized structures for real-world graphs, specifically via edge denoising \\cite{entezari2020all,tang2020transfer,jin2020graph,dai2022towards,wu2019adversarial}. Motivated by the observation that noisy edges connect nodes with dissimilar features \\cite{entezari2020all}, existing methods are generally guided by feature similarity measures. For instance, \\cite{wu2019adversarial} conducts edge pruning based on the Jaccard similarity between paired node features, Pro-GNN \\cite{jin2020graph} employs the feature smoothness regularization alongside low-rank constraints, and RS-GNN \\cite{dai2022towards} utilizes node feature similarity to guide the link prediction process. Nevertheless, graph structure learning (GSL) remains underexplored under the social context of fake news detection. Existing GSL methods are not readily applicable to this task, given the high computational costs incurred in computing pairwise similarity measures between high-dimensional news article representations on large-scale social graphs. While initial efforts have been made in conditioning the edge metric with node degrees for coordination detection \\cite{zhang2021vigdet}, the fixed adjustment formula adopted by existing work cannot fully capture the complex relations between degree-related properties, which may vary greatly across datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first learnable framework for social graph refinement, which leverages low-dimensional degree-related properties to flexibly adjust the edge weights of a news engagement graph for enhanced fake news detection.\n\n\n\n"

The benefit of DCSBM is that it allows us to simultaneously model the effect of \\emph{degree patterns} and \\emph{class labels}, which are of key interest, in a tractable probabilistic way. Based on the DCSBM model, we will then theoretically derive a principled likelihood ratio-based approach for graph structure learning for the fake news detection application.\n\n\\paragraph{Framework} We first formulate the standard DCSBM under our fake news detection scenario. Recall the news engagement graph $\\mathcal{G}=\\{\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{E}\\}$ formulated in Section \\ref{sec:newsgraph}, where $|\\mathcal{P}|=N$. Each news article node in $\\mathcal{G}$ is associated with a class label from the label space $\\mathcal{Z}=\\{0,1\\}$. Consider a pair of news article nodes $p_i\\in\\mathcal{P}$ and $p_j\\in\\mathcal{P}$ with co-engagement $C_{ij}$. The nodes have class labels $z_i\\in\\mathcal{Z}$ and $z_j\\in\\mathcal{Z}$, respectively. Recall that $C_{ij}$ is defined as the number of common users between $p_i$ and $p_j$. \n\nNext, to formulate structure learning under the DCSBM model, our basic intuition is that \\emph{same-class edges} (i.e., edges $e_{ij}$ where $z_i = z_j$) are more likely to be useful and informative than \\emph{cross-class edges} (i.e., edges where $z_i \\neq z_j$), and hence, structure learning should aim to give a higher weight to same-class edges. Intuitively, cross-class edges tend to indicate noisy edges, as in the example in Figure \\ref{fig:noise-example}, where the co-engagement between them arises just by chance. Moreover, since our main goal is to classify $p_i$, identifying edges where $z_i = z_j$ clearly provides highly useful information for this task. Hence, our key idea is to perform structure learning by deriving the \\emph{same-class likelihood ratio}:\n\\begin{defn}[Same-class likelihood ratio]\nThe same-class likelihood ratio, i.e. the likelihood ratio for $z_i = z_j$ over $z_i \\neq z_j$ when observing $C_{ij}$ edges between $p_i$ and $p_j$, is  \n\\begin{align}\n    LR_{ij} := \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(C_{ij}|z_i=z_j)}{\\mathbb{P}(C_{ij}|z_i\\neq z_j)}.\n\\end{align}\n\\end{defn}\nThe higher this likelihood ratio, the more evidence the data (specifically, $C_{ij}$) gives in favor of $z_i = z_j$ over $z_i \\neq z_j$; and hence, structure learning should give a higher weight to such edges.\n\n\\paragraph{Derivation} Under the DCSBM model, the $C_{ij}$ edges between $p_i$ and $p_j$ are independently Poisson distributed, i.e., $C_{ij}\\sim\\mathsf{Poi}(\\lambda_{ij})$, where $\\lambda_{ij}$ denotes the expected number of edges:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\lambda_{ij}= \\begin{cases} \n        \\beta_i \\beta_j p & \\text { if } z_i = z_j \\\\ \n        \\beta_i \\beta_j q & \\text { if } z_i \\neq z_j \n    \\end{cases},\n\\label{eq:lambda_ij}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\beta_i$ and $\\beta_j$ are the ``degree correction parameters'' that allow us to generate nodes with different degrees. $p$ and $q$ are parameters controlling the rate at which edges are generated under the same-class and cross-class cases, respectively. Generally, we have $p>q$, i.e., same-class edges have a higher tendency to be generated.\n\nThe corresponding maximum likelihood values $\\hat{\\beta{_i}}$ and $\\hat{\\beta{_j}}$ for $\\beta_i$ and $\\beta_j$ are given as\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{\\beta{_i}} = \\frac{d_i}{m},\\quad \\hat{\\beta{_j}} = \\frac{d_j}{m},\n\\label{eq:mle}\n\\end{equation}\nin the DCSBM model \\cite{karrer2011stochastic}, where $m=|\\mathcal{E}|$ denotes the number of edges. $d_i$ and $d_j$ respectively refer to the weighted degrees of nodes $p_i$ and $p_j$.\n\nSince $C_{ij}\\sim\\mathsf{Poi}(\\lambda_{ij})$, the likelihood ratio $LR_{ij}$ for $z_i=z_j$ over $z_i\\neq z_j$ can be derived as:\n\\begin{equation} \n\\begin{split}\n    LR_{ij} &= \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(C_{ij}|z_i=z_j)}{\\mathbb{P}(C_{ij}|z_i\\neq z_j)} \\\\\n    & = \\frac{e^{-\\beta_i \\beta_j p}(\\beta_i \\beta_j p)^{C_{ij}}}{e^{-\\beta_i \\beta_j q}(\\beta_i \\beta_j q)^{C_{ij}}} \\\\\n    & = e^{-\\beta_i\\beta_j(p-q)}(\\frac{p}{q})^{C_{ij}}.\n\\end{split}\n\\label{eq:likelihood-ratio}\n\\end{equation}\nSubstituting the $\\hat{\\beta{_i}}$ and $\\hat{\\beta{_j}}$ given in Eq.\\ref{eq:mle} into Eq.\\ref{eq:likelihood-ratio}, we derive the maximum likelihood estimate for $LR_{ij}$:\n\\begin{equation} \n   \\mathsf{MLE}(LR_{ij})=e^{-\\frac{d_i d_j}{m^2}(p-q)}(\\frac{p}{q})^{C_{ij}}.\n\\label{eq:sub-mle}\n\\end{equation}\nTreating $m, p, q$ as fixed (since they are shared by all nodes), we thus see that the MLE is a function of $C_{ij}$, $d_i$ and $d_j$: in particular, it is a \\emph{log-linear} function of $C_{ij}$ and $d_i d_j$:\n\\begin{align} \n   \\mathsf{MLE}(LR_{ij})&={\\Phi}(C_{ij}, d_i, d_j) := e^{-\\frac{d_i d_j}{m^2}(p-q)}(\\frac{p}{q})^{C_{ij}} \\\\ \n   &= \\exp\\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} C_{ij} \\\\ d_{i} d_j \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} \\log(p)-\\log(q) \\\\ -\\frac{p-q}{m^2} \\end{pmatrix} \\right] \\label{eq:Phi}\n\\end{align}\n\n\\paragraph{Implications} We first note that Eq. \\ref{eq:Phi} agrees with our empirical finding in Observation \\ref{obs_cij}: if we fix $d_i d_j$ in Eq. \\ref{eq:Phi}, then as long as $\\log(p)-\\log(q) > 0$, we observe that higher $C_{ij}$ is associated with a higher $LR_{ij}$, and thus a higher probability of same-class edges ($z_i = z_j$), agreeing with Figure \\ref{fig:co-engagement} where the Real-Fake edges have lowest $C_{ij}$ for a given $d_i d_j$.\n\nFor structure learning purposes, we could simply use ${\\Phi}(C_{ij}, d_i, d_j)$, which we recall is an estimator for $LR_{ij} = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(C_{ij}|z_i=z_j)}{\\mathbb{P}(C_{ij}|z_i\\neq z_j)}$. However, the standard DCSBM model is built upon relatively strong assumptions (e.g. pre-defined $p$ and $q$ values); for fitting real data, we would like to relax these assumptions and allow the model to be flexibly learned from data. The DCSBM model contains very few learnable parameters, which is a fundamental limitation in adapting to the complex degree-based patterns in the news engagement graph. This motivates us to develop DECOR, a degree-based learnable social graph refinement framework, which we will next describe in detail, by \\emph{relaxing the assumption of log-linearity}: that is, instead of treating ${\\Phi}(C_{ij}, d_i, d_j)$ as a fixed and log-linear function defined in Eq. \\ref{eq:Phi}, we instead treat it as a \\emph{learnable non-linear function $\\Tilde{\\Phi}(C_{ij}, d_i, d_j)$} to be updated jointly with the rest of the model, during the structure learning process. \n\n"

In light of our empirical findings on degree-veracity relationships and the DCSBM framework, we propose to learn a degree-corrected social graph that downweights the noisy edges to eliminate their negative impacts and facilitate fake news detection via GNN-based classifiers.\n\nRecall that the type of an edge in the news engagement graph (i.e. connecting new articles of same or different veracity) is characterized by the co-engagement and degrees of the connected articles. Motivated by the DCSBM model's degree-based probabilistic derivation of edge placement likelihood, we propose to adjust edge weights in the news engagement graph via learning a \\textit{social degree correction mask} $\\mathbf{M}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}$, where $\\mathbf{M}_{ij}$ in the interval $(0,1)$ represents the degree correction score for edge $e_{ij}$ between news article nodes $p_i$ and $p_j$.\n\nThe value of $\\mathbf{M}_{ij}$ is predicted given co-engagement $C_{ij}$ of articles $p_i$ and $p_j$, and the articles' weighted node degrees $d_i$ and $d_j$ from the news engagement graph.

To preserve computational efficiency, we design the social degree correction process as \\textit{pruning}. In other words, we conduct Eq.\\ref{eq:edgepred} on all the news pairs connected by common users to obtain the corresponding degree correction scores: \n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbf{M}_{i j}= \\begin{cases}v_{ij} & \\text { if } C_{ij}\\neq 0\\\\ \n    0 & \\text { else }\\end{cases}.\n\\label{eq:mask}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $v_{ij}$ denotes the softmax-normalized score in $\\mathbf{s}_{ij}$  that correlates with edge preservation. \n\nGiven the co-engagement matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ of news engagement graph $\\mathcal{G}$, we utilize $\\mathbf{M}$ to obtain a degree-corrected adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{A}_c$:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{A}} = \\mathbf{C}\\cdot \\mathbf{M} + \\mathbf{I}\n\\label{eq:corrected1}\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbf{A}_{c} = \\mathbf{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{A}} \\mathbf{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} ,\n\\label{eq:corrected2}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}$ represents an identity matrix of size $N$, and $\\mathbf{D}$ is the diagonal matrix of degrees for $\\mathbf{\\hat{A}}$.\n\nThrough the above operations, noisy edges in the news engagement graph are assigned smaller weights, as $\\Tilde\\Phi(\\cdot)$ in Eq.\\ref{eq:edgepred} leverages degree-based properties to predict a low degree correction score.\n\n"

From the subgraph on the left hand side, we observe that $p$ is involved in two types of edges: \\textit{\\textbf{(1)}} Noisy edges with large edge weights. $p$ is closely connected with three influential real news pieces. As these articles all focus on trending political topics, they attract a large number of common readers. \\textit{\\textbf{(2)}} Clean edges with small edge weights. $p$ is also connected with several fake news pieces; however, these articles attract less social users, which results in small groups of common readers with $p$. These structural patterns are problematic, as propagating information among noisy edges can contaminate the neighborhood, leading to suboptimal article representations. Existing social graph based models generally assume a fixed graph structure and are thereby heavily limited in suppressing edge noise. Prior works on similarity-guided edge denoising also cannot address this issue, as the articles contain similar topics but different veracity. In contrast, DECOR leverages the structural degree-based properties in a flexible manner. This facilitates the elimination of degree-related edge noise. From the subgraph on the right hand side of Figure \\ref{fig:case-study}, we find that DECOR effectively suppresses the noisy edges, and recognizes the clean edges by assigning larger weights.

To investigate if these observations are generalizable beyond political news (PolitiFact) and celebrity news (GossipCop), we extend our analysis to four additional news datasets covering three additional topics, namely three datasets from the MC-Fake benchmark \\cite{min2022divide} on different topics (Syria War, Health and Covid-19) and the FANG dataset \\cite{nguyen2020fang} (contains news articles about political events and influential rumor events). \n\nAs our observations are based on social user engagement patterns, we focus on the news instances with social user engagements, and filter the instances without any user engagement. More specifically, we record social user engagements in terms of source tweets reposting news articles and their retweets, and collect the corresponding user IDs. The descriptive statistics of the datasets are summarized in Table \\ref{tab:ds-stats-extended}.\n\nFollowing the same procedure of plotting Figure \\ref{fig:degree-cred} and Figure \\ref{fig:co-engagement} in Section \\ref{sec:empirical-obs}, we visualize the node degree distributions of real and fake news via KDE plots in Figure \\ref{fig:deg_kde_extend}, and present the co-engagement patterns of news article pairs in Figure \\ref{fig:co_engage_extend}. The plots are consistent with our two observations in that \\textit{\\textbf{(1)}} the degree distributions of nodes representing fake and real news articles exhibit a clear difference; and \\textit{\\textbf{(2)}} given the degrees, edges connecting fake and real news typically have the lowest co-engagement, whereas edges connecting fake news pairs typically have the highest co-engagement. This validates that our observed patterns are widely applicable to news of different topics, and demonstrates promising potential of applying veracity-related co-engagement and degree patterns to refine social graphs that involve news of varying topics.\n\n\n"

                    "name": "Discussion on Empirical Findings",
                    "content": "\n\nIn this subsection, we discuss the probable reasons leading to our Observation \\ref{obs_cij} (Section \\ref{sec:empirical-obs}) on veracity-related patterns between co-engagement and degrees, which forms the key motivation of DECOR. Recall that Observation \\ref{obs_cij} is two-fold: \\textbf{(A)} Real-Fake news article pairs have the lowest co-engagement given the degrees; and \\textbf{(B)} Fake-Fake pairs have higher co-engagement than real-real pairs given the degrees.\n\nWe find that both \\textbf{(A)} and \\textbf{(B)} closely relate with the confirmation bias theory \\cite{nickerson1998confirm}, which states that users tend to seek and interpret evidence that upholds their existing beliefs, so as to gain confidence in their biased views. \n\nIn terms of  \\textbf{(A)}, as social media platforms foster echo chambers \\cite{garimella18political} that insulate users from opposing viewpoints, social users tend to repeatedly engage in spreading news articles on certain topics with similar veracity. Hence, social users are less likely to share interest in two news articles of different veracity types (i.e., Real-Fake pairs), which accounts for lower co-engagement than Fake-Fake and Real-Real pairs with the same veracity type.\n\nThe underlying phenomena for \\textbf{(B)} may vary, as the effects of confirmation bias can be manifested in different forms under different topics. Under topics such as politics \\cite{vicario19polarization} or Covid-19 \\cite{modgil21confirm}, social media platforms can induce opinion polarization, where the user's attention is highly segregated on a set of certain opinions. In terms of celebrity gossip, certain groups of social media users can engage in boundary coordination to gain control over the information \\cite{mcnealy19tea}. These phenomena result in sharp community structures, which can be quantified via increased co-engagements.\n\nIn conclusion, our second empirical observation can be partially explained by multiple phenomena, and the underlying phenomena can differ across different topics. The benefits of our proposed DECOR framework (Section \\ref{sec:decor}) is that through incorporating a learnable degree correction mechanism, the model is able to recognize the complex veracity-related degree patterns in a more flexible manner. Hence, DECOR facilitates effective detection of news articles without loss of computational efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
