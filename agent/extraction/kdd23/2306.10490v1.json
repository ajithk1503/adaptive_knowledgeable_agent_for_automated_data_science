        "abstract": "The success of Computer Vision (CV) relies heavily on manually annotated\ndata. However, it is prohibitively expensive to annotate images in key domains\nsuch as healthcare, where data labeling requires significant domain expertise\nand cannot be easily delegated to crowd workers. To address this challenge, we\npropose a neuro-symbolic approach called Rapid, which infers image labeling\nrules from a small amount of labeled data provided by domain experts and\nautomatically labels unannotated data using the rules. Specifically, Rapid\ncombines pre-trained CV models and inductive logic learning to infer the\nlogic-based labeling rules. Rapid achieves a labeling accuracy of 83.33% to\n88.33% on four image labeling tasks with only 12 to 39 labeled samples. In\nparticular, Rapid significantly outperforms finetuned CV models in two highly\nspecialized tasks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Rapid in\nlearning from small data and its capability to generalize among different\ntasks.
