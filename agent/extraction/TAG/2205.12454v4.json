Graph Transformers (GTs) have gained popularity in the field\nof graph representation learning with a variety of recent publications but they\nlack a common foundation about what constitutes a good positional or structural\nencoding, and what differentiates them. In this paper, we summarize the\ndifferent types of encodings with a clearer definition and categorize them as\nbeing $\\textit{local}$, $\\textit{global}$ or $\\textit{relative}$. The prior GTs\nare constrained to small graphs with a few hundred nodes, here we propose the\nfirst architecture with a complexity linear in the number of nodes and edges\n$O(N+E)$ by decoupling the local real-edge aggregation from the fully-connected\nTransformer. We argue that this decoupling does not negatively affect the\nexpressivity, with our architecture being a universal function approximator on\ngraphs. Our GPS recipe consists of choosing 3 main ingredients: (i)\npositional/structural encoding, (ii) local message-passing mechanism, and (iii)\nglobal attention mechanism. We provide a modular framework $\\textit{GraphGPS}$\nthat supports multiple types of encodings and that provides efficiency and\nscalability both in small and large graphs.

Particular challenges emerge with explicit edge features that are incorporated as attention bias in fully-connected graph transformers~\\cite{kreuzer2021rethinking, ying2021graphormer}.\nLinear transformers do not materialize the attention matrix directly, hence incorporating edge features becomes a non-trivial task.\nIn this work, we hypothesize that explicit edge features are not necessary for the \\emph{global graph attention} and adopt Performer~\\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/ChoromanskiLDSG21} and BigBird~\\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/ZaheerGDAAOPRWY20} as exemplary linear attention mechanisms.\n\nOur contributions are as follows. (i) Provide a general, powerful, scalable (\\method) GT blueprint that incorporates positional and structural encodings with local message passing and global attention, visualized in Figure \\ref{fig:visual-abstract}. (ii) Provide a better definition of PEs and SEs and organize them into \\textit{local, global}, and \\textit{relative} categories. (iii) Show that \\method with linear global attention, e.g., provided by Performer \\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/ChoromanskiLDSG21} or BigBird \\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/ZaheerGDAAOPRWY20}, scales to graphs with several thousand nodes and demonstrates competitive results even without explicit edge features within the attention module, whereas existing fully-connected GTs \\cite{kreuzer2021rethinking, ying2021graphormer} are limited to graphs of up to few hundred nodes. (iv) Conduct an extensive ablation study that evaluates contribution of PEs, local MPNN, and global attention components in perspective of several benchmarking datasets. (v) Finally, following the success of GraphGym~\\cite{you2020design} we implement the blueprint within a modular and performant \\gtgym package. \n\n\n\n\n\n%##############################################################################\n% \\vspace{-4pt}\n"

Particularly, they are expected to help alleviate the problems of over-smoothing and over-squashing \\cite{alon2021on, topping2021understanding_ricci} in MPNNs, which are analogous to the vanishing gradients and lack of long-term dependencies in NLP. Fully-connected Graph Transformer~\\cite{dwivedi2020generalization} was first introduced together with rudimentary utilisation of eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian as the node positional encoding (PE), to provide the otherwise graph-unaware Transformer a sense of nodes' location in the input graph.\nBuilding on top of this work, SAN~\\cite{kreuzer2021rethinking} implemented an invariant aggregation of Laplacian's eigenvectors for the PE, alongside conditional attention for real and virtual edges of a graph, which jointly yielded significant improvements.\n% Building on top of this work, SAN implemented a learnable Laplacian PE alongside a separate head for the local/global aggregations, which yielded significant improvements \\cite{kreuzer2021rethinking}.\nConcurrently, Graphormer~\\cite{ying2021graphormer,shi2022benchgraphormer} proposed using pair-wise graph distances (or 3D distances) to define relative positional encodings, with outstanding success on large molecular benchmarks.\nFurther, GraphiT~\\cite{mialon2021graphit} used relative PE derived from diffusion kernels to modulate the attention between nodes. Finally, GraphTrans~\\cite{jain2021graphtrans} proposed the first hybrid architecture, first using a stack of MPNN layers, before fully-connecting the graph.\nSince, the field has continued to propose alternative GTs: SAT~\\cite{chen2022SAT}, EGT~\\cite{hussain2022EGT}, GRPE~\\cite{park2022GRPE}.\n\n\\myparagraph{Positional and structural encodings.}\nThere have been many recent works on PE and SE, notably on Laplacian PE \\cite{dwivedi2020generalization,kreuzer2021rethinking, beaini2021directional_dgn,wang2022equivstable,lim2022sign}, shortest-path-distance \\cite{li2020distance,ying2021graphormer}, node degree centrality \\cite{ying2021graphormer}, kernel distance \\cite{mialon2021graphit}, random-walk SE \\cite{dwivedi2022LPE}, structure-aware \\cite{chen2022SAT, bouritsas2022improving_GSN,bodnar2021weisfeiler_CIN}, and more. Some works also propose dedicated networks to learn the PE/SE from an initial encoding \\cite{kreuzer2021rethinking, dwivedi2022LPE, lim2022sign, chen2022SAT}. To better understand the different PE/SE and the contribution of each work, we categorize them in Table~\\ref{tab:pe_se} and examine their effect in Section \\ref{sec:need_pe_se}. In most cases, PE/SE are used as soft bias, meaning they are simply provided as input features. But in other cases, they can be used to direct the messages \\cite{beaini2021directional_dgn} or create \\textit{bridges} between distant nodes \\cite{koutis2019spectral, topping2021understanding_ricci}.\n\n\\myparagraph{Linear Transformers.}\nThe \\emph{quadratic} complexity of attention in the original Transformer architecture~\\cite{vaswani2017attention} motivated the search for more efficient attention mechanisms that would scale \\emph{linearly} with the sequence length. \nMost of such \\emph{linear transformers} are developed for language modeling tasks, e.g., Linformer~\\cite{Wang2020LinformerSW}, Reformer~\\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/KitaevKL20}, Longformer~\\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2004-05150}, Performer~\\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/ChoromanskiLDSG21}, BigBird~\\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/ZaheerGDAAOPRWY20}, and have a dedicated Long Range Arena benchmark~\\cite{tay2021long} to study the limits of models against extremely long input sequences.\nPyraformer~\\cite{liu2022pyraformer} is an example of a linear transformer for time series data, whereas S4~\\cite{gu2022efficiently} is a more general signal processing approach that employs the state space model theory without the attention mechanism. \nIn the graph domain, linear transformers are not well studied. \\citet{choromanski2021blocktoeplitz} are the first to adapt Performer-style attention kernelization to small graphs.\n\n\n%##############################################################################\n\\vspace{-3pt}\n"

We begin by categorization of existing positional (PE) and structural encodings (SE), a necessary ingredient for graph Transformers. Next, we analyse how these encodings also increase expressive power of MPNNs. The increased expressivity thus provides double benefit to our hybrid MPNN+Transformer architecture, which we introduce in Section~\\ref{sec:gps_layer}. Last but not least, we provide an extensible implementation of \\method in \\gtgym package, built on top of PyG~\\cite{FeyLenssen2019PyG} and GraphGym~\\cite{you2020design}.\n% The key ideas of our current work is to provide a modular/general, powerful/expressive, and fast/scalable architecture for graph Transformers.

It was shown in previous works that they are one of the most important factors in driving the performance of graph Transformers. Thus, a better understanding and organization of the PE and SE will aid in building of a more modular architecture and in guiding of the future research.\n\nWe propose to organize the PE and SE into 3 categories: \\textbf{local}, \\textbf{global} and \\textbf{relative} in order to facilitate the integration within the pipeline and facilitate new research directions. They are presented visually in Figure \\ref{fig:visual-abstract}, with more details in Table \\ref{tab:pe_se}. Although PE and SE can appear similar to some extent, they are different yet complementary. PE gives a notion of distance, while SE gives a notion of structural similarity. One can always infer certain notions of distance from large structures, or certain notions of structure from short distances, but this is not a trivial task, and the objective of providing PE and SE remains distinct, as discussed in the following subsections.\n\nDespite presenting a variety of possible functions, we focus our empirical evaluations on the \\textbf{global PE}, \\textbf{relative PE} and \\textbf{local SE} since they are known to yield significant improvements. We leave the empirical evaluation of other encodings for future work.\n\n\n\\myparagraph{Positional encodings (PE)}  are meant to provide an idea of the \\textit{position in space} of a given node within the graph. Hence, when two nodes are close to each other within a graph or subgraph, their PE should also be close. A common approach is to compute the pair-wise distance between each pairs of nodes or their eigenvectors as proposed in \\cite{li2020distance, ying2021graphormer, kreuzer2021rethinking, wang2022equivstable}, but this is not compatible with linear Transformers as it requires to materialize the full attention matrix~\\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/ChoromanskiLDSG21}. Instead, we want the PE to either be features of the nodes or real edges of the graph, thus a better fitting solution is to use the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian or their gradient \\cite{dwivedi2020benchmarking, beaini2021directional_dgn, kreuzer2021rethinking}. See Table~\\ref{tab:pe_se} for more PE examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\myparagraph{Structural encodings (SE)} are meant to provide an embedding of the structure of graphs or subgraphs to help increase the expressivity and the generalizability of graph neural networks (GNN). Hence, when two nodes share similar subgraphs, or when two graphs are similar, their SE should also be close. Simple approaches are to identify pre-defined patterns in the graphs as one-hot encodings, but they require expert knowledge of graphs \\cite{bouritsas2022improving_GSN, bodnar2021weisfeiler_CIN}. Instead, using the diagonal of the $m$-steps random-walk matrix encodes richer information into each node \\cite{dwivedi2022LPE}, such as for odd $m$ it can indicate if a node is a part of an $m$-long cycle. Structural encodings can also be used to define the \\textit{global} graph structure, for instance using the eigenvalues of the Laplacian, or as \\textit{relative} edge features to identify if nodes are contained within the same clusters, with more examples in Table~\\ref{tab:pe_se}.\n\n\n"

In this section, we present an examination of PE and SE by showing how message-passing networks, despite operating on the graph structure, remain blind to the information encapsulated by the PE and SE.\n\n\\myparagraph{1-Weisfeiler-Leman test (1-WL).}\nIt is well known that standard MPNNs are as expressive as the 1-WL test, meaning that they fail to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs under a 1-hop aggregation. We argue that the selected \\textit{local}, \\textit{global} and \\textit{relative} PE/SE allow MPNNs to become more expressive than the 1-WL test, thus making them fundamentally more expressive at distinguishing between nodes and graphs.\nTo this end, we study the following two types of graphs (Figure~\\ref{fig:pe_se_main} and Appendix~\\ref{app:WL}).\n%To this end, we study two types of graphs shown in Figures~\\ref{fig:pe_se_main}~and~\\ref{fig:pe_se_example}, with further details provided in Appendix~\\ref{app:WL}.\n\n% \\begin{figure}[t]\n%     \\vspace{-15pt}\n%   \\centering\n%   \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{pe_se_example.pdf}\n%   \\vspace{-3pt}\n%   \\caption{Example graphs with anonymous nodes:\n%   %\\textit{i.e.}, nodes do not have any distinguishing node features:\n%   (a) A pair of Circular Skip Link (CSL) graphs \\cite{murphy2019relational} where the nodes have skip links of 2 and 3 respectively. (b) A Decalin molecular graph that is composed of two rings of all Carbon atoms, thus has no distinguishing node features.\n%   }\n%   \\label{fig:pe_se_example_small}\n% \\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\myparagraph{Circular Skip Link (CSL) graph.}\nIn a CSL graph-pair \\cite{murphy2019relational}, \n% Figures~\\ref{fig:pe_se_main:a}~and~\\ref{fig:pe_se_example:a}, \nwe want to be able to distinguish the two non-isomorphic graphs. Since the 1-WL algorithm produces the same color for every node in both graphs, also every MPNN will fail to distinguish them. However, using a \\textit{global} PE (e.g., Laplacian PE \\cite{dwivedi2020benchmarking}) assigns each node a unique initial color and makes the CSL graph-pair distinguishable. This demonstrates that an MPNN cannot learn such a PE from the graph structure alone. Next, using a \\textit{local} SE (e.g., diagonals of $m$-steps random walk) can successfully capture the difference in the skip links of the two graphs \\cite{loukas2020graph}, resulting in their different node coloring~\\cite{dwivedi2022LPE}.\n\n\\myparagraph{Decalin molecule.}\nIn the bicyclic Decalin graph, Figures~\\ref{fig:pe_se_main:b}~and~\\ref{fig:pe_se_example:b}, the node $a$ is isomorphic to node $b$, and so is the node $c$ to node $d$. A \\mbox{1-WL} coloring of the nodes, and analogously MPNN, would generate one color for the nodes $a,b$ and another color for $c,d$. The same applies to the aforementioned \\textit{local} SE \\cite{dwivedi2022LPE}. In case of link prediction, this causes potential links $(a,d)$ and $(b,d)$ to be indistinguishable \\cite{zhang2021labeling}. \n%However, certain tasks could require distinguishing between a potential link $(a,d)$ with another potential link $(b,d)$ with $(b,d)$ \\cite{zhang2021labeling}. \nUsing a distance-based \\textit{relative} PE on the edges or an eigenvector-based \\textit{global} PE, however, would allow to differentiate the two links.\n% It henceforth justifies the theoretical need to encode PE and SE at any or all of the 3 levels discussed to make the MPNN strictly powerful than 1-WL.\n\n% More details on the 1-WL test and how PE and SE help distinguishing the CSL graph and the nodes of the Decalin molecule are presented in Appendix~\\ref{app:WL}.\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "content": "\\label{sec:gps_layer}\n% In this section, we argue the different motivations behind using a hybrid MPNN+Transformer layer, which goes against most of the published methods. First, such layer facilitates scaling of the GT linearly to the number of nodes and edges, secondly it helps avoiding over-smoothing and over-squashing in the first layers. Finally, we present the equations for the update function.\n% \\vd{(VD: This paragraph needs re-writing as the scalability part is moved up. An alternative is drafted as follows.)}\n\nIn this section we introduce the GPS layer, which is a hybrid MPNN+Transformer layer. First we argue how it alleviates the limitation of a closely related work. Next, we list the layer update equations which can be instantiated with a variety of MPNN and Transformer layers. Finally, we present its characteristics in terms of modularity, scalability and expressivity.\n\n% Most of the proposed methods in the literature, such as GT~\\cite{dwivedi2020generalization}, SAN~\\cite{kreuzer2021rethinking}, Graphormer~\\cite{ying2021graphormer} use a model based purely on full self-attention, while only GraphTrans~\\cite{jain2021graphtrans} uses a hybrid architecture. Yet, even GraphTrans first starts with MPNN module before applying the full self-attention stack.\n\n% \\myparagraph{Scalability and expressivity.} As mentioned in previous sections, processing the edges separately in the MPNN allows for the use of linear Transformers. Indeed, the MPNN complexity is $O(E)$ and the linear Transformers are $O(N)$. For sparse graphs such as molecular graphs, regular graphs, and knowledge graphs, the edges are practically proportional to the nodes $E = \\Theta(N)$, meaning the entire complexity becomes linear to the number of nodes $O(N)$.\n\n\\myparagraph{Preventing early smoothing.} Why not use an architecture like GraphTrans \\cite{jain2021graphtrans} comprising of a few layers of MPNNs before the Transformer? Since MPNNs are limited by problems of over-smoothing, over-squashing, and low expressivity against the WL test \\cite{alon2021on,topping2021understanding_ricci}, these layers could \\textit{irreparably} fail to keep some information in the early stage. Although they could make use of PE/SE or more expressive MPNNs \\cite{beaini2021directional_dgn, dwivedi2022LPE}, they are still likely to lose information. An analogous 2-stage strategy was successful in computer vision \\cite{dascoli2021convit, guo2021cmt} thanks to the high expressivity of convolutional layers on grids, but we do not expect it to achieve the same success on graphs due to the limitations of message-passing.\n\n\n\\newcommand{\\mpnn}{\\texttt{MPNN}\\xspace}\n\\newcommand{\\attn}{\\texttt{GlobalAttn}\\xspace}\n\\newcommand{\\X}{\\mathbf{X}}\n\\newcommand{\\E}{\\mathbf{E}}\n\\newcommand{\\A}{\\mathbf{A}}\n\\myparagraph{Update function.}\nAt each layer, the features are updated by aggregating the output of an MPNN layer with that of a global attention layer, as shown in Figures~\\ref{fig:visual-abstract}~and~\\ref{fig:gps_layer}, and described by the equations below. Note that the edge features are only passed to the \\mpnn layer, and that residual connections with batch normalization~\\cite{ioffe2015batchnorm} are omitted for clarity.

Further, as research advances in different directions, \\gtgym allows to easily implement new PE/SE and other layers.\n\n\\myparagraph{Scalability} is achieved by allowing for a computational complexity linear in both the number of nodes and edges $O(N+E)$; excluding the potential precomputation step required for various PE, such as Laplacian eigen-decomposition.\nBy restricting the PE/SE to real nodes and edges, and by excluding the edge features from the global attention layer, we can avoid materializing the full quadratic attention matrix. Therefore we can utilize a linear Transformer with $O(N)$ complexity, while the complexity of an MPNN is $O(E)$. For sparse graphs such as molecular graphs, regular graphs, and knowledge graphs, the edges are practically proportional to the nodes $E = \\Theta(N)$, meaning the entire complexity can be considered linear in the number of nodes $O(N)$.\nEmpirically, even on small molecular graphs, our architecture reduces computation time compared to other GT models, e.g., a model of \\textasciitilde6M parameters requires 196s per epoch on the ogbg-molpcba~\\cite{hu2020ogb} dataset, compared to 883s for SAN \\cite{kreuzer2021rethinking} on the same GPU type.\n\n\n\\myparagraph{Expressivity} in terms of sub-structure identification and the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test is achieved via providing a rich set of PE/SE, as proposed in various works \\cite{beaini2021directional_dgn, kreuzer2021rethinking, dwivedi2022LPE, bodnar2021weisfeiler_CIN, bouritsas2022improving_GSN} and detailed in Section \\ref{sec:pe_se}. Further, the Transformer allows to resolve the expressivity bottlenecks caused by over-smoothing \\cite{kreuzer2021rethinking} and over-squashing \\cite{alon2021on} by allowing information to spread across the graph via full-connectivity. Finally, in Section~\\ref{sec:theory}, we demonstrate that, given the right components, the proposed architecture does not lose edge information and is a universal function approximator on graphs.\n\n\n\n% \\vspace{-3pt}\n"

Recent 2-step methods GraphTrans~\\cite{jain2021graphtrans} and SAT~\\cite{chen2022SAT} can use edge features in their first MPNN step, however this step is applied only once and typically includes several $k$ rounds of message passing. Therefore this latter approach may suffer from initial over-smoothing, as $k$-hop neighborhoods together with the respective edge features need to be represented in a fixed-sized node representation.\n\nOn the other hand, in \\method, interleaving one round of local neighborhood aggregation via an MPNN layer with global self-attention mechanism reduces the initial representation bottleneck and enables iterative local and global interactions. In the attention, the key-query-value mechanism only explicitly depends on the node features, but assuming efficient representation encoding by the MPNN, the node features can implicitly encode edge information, thus edges can play a role in either the key, query, or values. In Appendix \\ref{app:edge-in-attention}, we give a more formal argument on how, following an MPNN layer, node features can encode edge features alongside information related to node-connectivity.\n\n\n% \\subsubsection{Universal function approximator on graphs}\n% \\label{sec:universal}\n\\myparagraph{Universal function approximator on graphs.}\n\\citet{kreuzer2021rethinking}[Sec.~3.5] demonstrated the universality of graph Transformers. It was shown that, given the full set of Laplacian eigenvectors, the model was a universal function approximator on graphs and could provide an approximate solution to the isomorphism problem, making it more powerful than any Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) isomorphism test given enough parameters.\nHere, we argue that the same holds for our architecture since we can also use the full set of eigenvectors, and since all edge information can be propagated to the nodes.\n\n% \\textcolor{blue}{TODO -- mention how this is WL-inf, same as SAN}\n\n% \\lr{Argument / proof about WL expressivity of our model -- Reuse argument from SAN and Vijay's Learnable PE about RWSE.}\n% \\db{Don't think we need this, I already stated earlier the proofs from SAN and RWSE that are valid and we are >1-WL, without proof.}\n\n\n\n%##############################################################################\n% \\vspace{-3pt}\n"

Then, we evaluate \\method on a diverse set of 11 benchmarking datasets, and show state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in many cases.\n\n\nWe test on datasets from different sources to ensure diversity, providing their detailed description in Appendix~\\ref{app:datasets}. From the Benchmarking GNNs~\\cite{dwivedi2020benchmarking}, we test on the ZINC, PATTERN, CLUSTER, MNIST, CIFAR10. From the open graph benchmark (OGB)~\\cite{hu2020ogb}, we test on all graph-level datasets: ogbg-molhiv, ogbg-molpcba, ogbg-code2, and ogbg-ppa, and from their large-scale challenge we test on the OGB-LSC PCQM4Mv2~\\cite{hu2021ogblsc}. Finally, we also select MalNet-Tiny~\\cite{freitas2021malnet} with 5000 graphs, each of up to 5000 nodes, since the number of nodes provide a scaling challenge for Transformers.\n\n",

                    "name": "Ablation studies",
                    "content": "\\label{sec:ablations}\nIn this section, we evaluate multiple options for the three main components of our architecture in order to gauge their contribution to predictive performance and to better guide dataset-specific hyper-parameter optimization. First, we quantify benefits of the considered global-attention modules in 4 tasks. Then, we note that the MPNN layer is an essential part for high-performing models, and identify the layer type most likely to help. Finally, we observe when different global PE or local SE provide significant boost in the performance.\nAll ablation results are averaged over multiple random seeds and summarized in Table~\\ref{fig:ablations}, with additional information available in Appendix~\\ref{app:exp_ablations}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Global-Attention module.}\nHere we consider global attention implemented as $O(N^2)$ key-query-value Transformer attention or linear-time attention mechanisms of Performer or BigBird. We notice in Table~\\ref{tab:ablation-mpnn-transformer} that using a Transformer is always beneficial, except for the ZINC dataset where no changes are observed. This motivates our architecture and the hypothesis that long-range dependencies are generally important. We further observe that Performer falls behind Transformer in terms of the predictive performance, although it provides a gain over the baseline and the ability to scale to very large graphs. Finally, BigBird in our setting offers no significant gain, while also being slower than Performer (see Appendix~\\ref{app:exp_ablations}).\n\nHaving no gain on the ZINC dataset is expected since the task is a combination of the computed octanol-water partition coefficient (cLogP) \\cite{wildman1999prediction_logp} and the synthetic accessibility score (SA-score) \\cite{ertl2009estimation_sascore}, both of which only count occurrences of local sub-structures. Hence, there is no need for a global connectivity, but a strong need for structural encodings.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Message-passing module.} Next, we evaluate the effect of various message-passing architectures, Table~\\ref{tab:ablation-mpnn-transformer}. It is apparent that they are fundamental to the success of our method: removing the layer leads to a significant drop in performance across all datasets. Indeed, without an MPNN, the edge features are not taken into consideration at all. Additionally, without reinforcing of the local graph structure, the network can overfit to the PE/SE. This reiterates findings of \\citet{kreuzer2021rethinking}, where considerably larger weights were assigned to the local attention.\n\nWe also find that although a vanilla PNA~\\cite{corso2020principal_pna} generally outperforms GINE~\\cite{hu2019strategies_GINE} and GatedGCN~\\cite{bresson2017GatedGCN}, adding the PE and SE results in major performance boost especially for the GatedGCN. This is consistent with results of \\citet{dwivedi2022LPE} and shows the importance of these encodings for gating.\n\nPerhaps the necessity of a local message-passing module is due to the limited amount of graph data, and scaling to colossal datasets \\cite{raffel2020t5} that we encounter in language and vision could change that. Indeed, the Graphormer architecture \\cite{ying2021graphormer} was able to perform very well on the full PCQM4Mv2 dataset without a local module. However, even large Transformer-based language models \\cite{chelombiev2021groupbert} and vision models \\cite{han2022survey_vision_transformer} can benefit from an added local aggregation and outperform pure Transformers.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Positional/Structural Encodings.}\nFinally, we evaluate the effects of various PE/SE schemes, Table~\\ref{tab:ablation-pe-se}. We find them generally beneficial to downstream tasks, in concordance to the vast literature on the subject (see Table~\\ref{tab:pe_se}). The benefits of the different encodings are very dataset dependant, with the random-walk structural encoding (RWSE) being more beneficial for molecular data and the Laplacian eigenvectors encodings (LapPE) being more beneficial in image superpixels. However, using SignNet with DeepSets encoding~\\cite{lim2022sign} as an improved way of processing the LapPE seems to be consistently successful across tasks. We hypothesize that SignNet can learn structural representation using the eigenvectors, for example, to generate local heat-kernels that approximate random walks~\\cite{andres2016heat}. Last but not least we evaluate PEG-layer design \\cite{wang2022equivstable} with Laplacian eigenmap. %, applied to respective evaluated MPNN layer.\n\n% We have observed in some experiments that using different PE/SE simultaneously can often be beneficial, which motivates our architectural choice. \\db{For instance, we use it on the ogbg-molPCBA dataset to achieve SOTA results.} However, we leave the study of such combination for future work.\n\n\n% \\vspace{-3pt}\n"

To ensure diverse benchmarking tasks, we use datasets from Benchmarking-GNNs \\cite{dwivedi2020benchmarking}, OGB \\cite{hu2020ogb} and its large-scale challenge \\cite{hu2021ogblsc}, and Long-Range Graph Benchmark \\cite{dwivedi2022LRGB}, with more details given in Appendix \\ref{app:datasets}.

On the molhiv dataset, we observed our model to suffer from overfitting, but to still outperform SAN, while other graph Transformers do not report results. For the molpcba, ppa, and code2, \\method always ranks among the top 3 models, highlighting again the versatility and expressiveness of the \\method approach. Further, \\method outperforms every other GT on all 4 benchmarks, except SAT on code2.\n\n\\myparagraph{OGB-LSC PCQM4Mv2 \\cite{hu2021ogblsc}.}\nThe large-scale PCQM4Mv2 dataset has been a popular benchmark for recent GTs, particularly due to Graphormer~\\cite{ying2021graphormer} winning the initial challenge. We report the results in Table~\\ref{tab:results_pcqm4m}, observing significant improvements over message-passing networks at comparable parameter budget. \\method also outperforms GRPE~\\cite{park2022GRPE}, EGT~\\cite{hussain2022EGT}, and Graphormer \\cite{ying2021graphormer} with less than half their parameters, and with significantly less overfitting on the training set.\nContrarily to Graphormer, we do not need to precompute spatial distances from approximate 3D molecular conformers \\cite{ying2021first}, the RWSEs we utilize are graph-based only.\n\n\\myparagraph{MalNet-Tiny.}\nThe MalNet-Tiny~\\cite{freitas2021malnet} dataset consists of function call graphs with up to 5,000 nodes. These graphs are considerably larger than previously considered inductive graph-learning benchmarks, which enables us to showcase scalability of \\method to much larger graphs than prior methods. Our \\method reaches $92.72\\% \\pm 0.7\\mathrm{pp}$ test accuracy when using Performer global attention. Interestingly, using Transformer global attention leads to further improved \\method performance, $93.36\\% \\pm 0.6\\mathrm{pp}$ (based on 10 runs), albeit at the cost of doubled run-time. In both cases, we used comparable architecture to \\citet{freitas2021malnet}, with 5 layers and 64 dimensional hidden node representation, and outperform their best GIN model with $90\\%$ accuracy.

We abide to the \\textasciitilde500k model parameter budget and closely follow the experimental setup and hyperparameter choices of the graph Transformer baselines tested in LRGB~\\cite{dwivedi2022LRGB}. We keep the same node/edge encoders and model depth (number of layers), deviating only in two aspects: i) we slightly decrease the size of hidden node representations to fit within the parameter budget, ii) we employ cosine learning rate schedule as in our other experiments (Section \\ref{app:hyperparams}). For each dataset we utilize LapPE positional encodings and GPS with GatedGCN~\\cite{bresson2017GatedGCN} and Transformer~\\cite{vaswani2017attention} components.\n\nGPS improves over all evaluated baselines in 4 out of 5 LRGB datasets (Table~\\ref{tab:results_lrgb}). Additionally, we conducted GPS ablation studies on PascalVOC-SP and Peptides-func datasets in the same fashion as for 4 previous datasets in Table~\\ref{fig:ablations}, presented in Tables~\\ref{tab:abl_pascal}~and~\\ref{tab:abl_peptidesfunc}, respectively. For both datasets the global attention, in form of Transformer or Performer, is shown to be a critical component of the GPS in outperforming MPNNs. In the case of PascalVOC-SP, interestingly, the Laplacian PEs are not beneficial, as without them the GPS scores even higher F1-score $0.3846$, and PEG~\\cite{wang2022equivstable} relative distance embeddings enable the highest score of $0.3956$.\n\n\n\n\n%##############################################################################\n\\vspace{-3pt}\n% \\newpage\n"

In our ablation studies, we demonstrated the importance of each module: the Transformer, flexible message-passing, and rich positional and structural encodings all contributed to the success of \\method on a wide variety of benchmarks. Indeed, considering 5 Benchmarking-GNN tasks \\cite{dwivedi2020benchmarking}, 5 OGB(-LSC) tasks \\cite{hu2020ogb,hu2021ogblsc}, 5 LRGB tasks \\cite{dwivedi2022LRGB} and MalNet-Tiny, we outperformed every graph Transformer on 11 out of 16 tasks while also achieving state-of-the-art on 8 of them. We further showed that the model can scale to very large graphs of several thousand nodes, far beyond any previous graph Transformer. By open-sourcing the \\gtgym package, we hope to accelerate the research in efficient and expressive graph Transformers, and move the field closer to a unified hybrid Transformer architecture for graphs.\n\n\\textbf{Limitations.} We find that graph transformers are sensitive to hyperparameters and there is no \\emph{one-size-fits-all} solution for all datasets. We also identify a lack of challenging graph datasets necessitating long-range dependencies where linear attention architectures could exhibit all scalability benefits. \n\n\\textbf{Societal Impact.} As a general graph representation learning method, we do not foresee immediate negative societal outcomes. However, its particular application, e.g., in drug discovery or computational biology, will have to be thoroughly examined for trustworthiness or malicious usage.\n\n\n%###########################################################\n% Do NOT include Acknowledgments in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper.

Should we keep the statement? Feel free to revise the statement for more precision.}\n\nIn this section, we review the 1-Weisfeiler-Leman test \\cite{weisfeiler1968reduction}, their equivalence with MPNNs and the limitations brought by this equivalent expressive power which eventually brings us to a statement that indicates the theoretical need of equipping MPNNs or GTs with either or a combination of local, relative or global PE/SE.\n\n\n\\paragraph{1-Weisfeiler-Leman test (1-WL).}\nThe 1-WL test is a node-coloring algorithm, in the hierarchy of Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) heuristics for graph isomorphism, \\cite{weisfeiler1968reduction}, which iteratively updates the color of a node based on its 1-hop local neighborhood until an iteration when the node colors do not change successively. The final histogram of the node colors determine whether the algorithm outputs the two graphs to be `non-isomorphic' (when the histograms of 2 graphs are distinct) or `possibly isomorphic' (when the histograms of 2 graphs are same). Although, it is not a sufficient test for the graph isomorphism problem, the heuristic is simple to apply and has been popularly used in the literature recently to quantify the expressive power of MPNNs.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Expressive power of MPNNs.} Based on the equivalence of the aggregate and update functions of MPNNs with the hash function of the 1-WL test, it was shown that MPNNs are at most powerful as 1-WL \\cite{xu2018how, morris2019}, which is now popularly understood in the literature. Graph Isomorphism Network \\cite{xu2018how} was developed by aligning the injectivity of the aggregate and update functions of GIN with the injectivity of the 1-WL's hash function, which makes it a 1-WL powerful MPNN. In direct consequence, the power of the GIN is quantified as 1-WL expressive, \\textit{i.e.}, if 1-WL outputs two graphs to be `non-isomorphic' then the GIN would output different feature vectors for the two graphs and conversely, if 1-WL outputs two graphs to be `possibly isomorphic', the feature embeddings of the two graphs would be the same. We refer the readers to \\cite{xu2018how} for the details on this theoretical result.\n\nSince the expressive power of MPNNs are at most 1-WL, it leads to a serious limitation in distinguishing a wide-variety of non-isomorphic graphs \\cite{sato2020survey}. Note that numerous follow up works have proposed GNNs that are strictly powerful than 1-WL, often moving away from the message passing framework \\cite{gilmer2017neural} on which MPNNs are based \\cite{morris2019, chen2019equivalence, maron2019provably}. As higher-order GNNs are not within the scope of this section, we limit our discussion only to MPNNs, such as GINs, which makes them 1-WL powerful.\nThere are numerous examples on which MPNNs fail as a result \\cite{sato2020survey}. Among such cases, we consider two examples tasks: the task to differentiate between two non-isomorphic Circular Skip Link (CSL) graphs, Figure \\ref{fig:pe_se_example:a}, and the task to differentiate between two potential links, Figure \\ref{fig:pe_se_example:b}. The nodes in these examples do not have discriminating node features.\n\n\n% It is well known that standard MPNNs are as expressive as the 1-WL test, meaning that they fail to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs under a 1-hop aggregation. In this section, we argue that the selected \\textit{local}, \\textit{global} and \\textit{relative} PE/SE allow MPNNs to become more expressive than the 1-WL by looking at the examples from  Figure~\\ref{fig:pe_se_example} in the Appendix, thus making them fundamentally more expressive at distinguishing between nodes and graphs.\n\n\n\n\n% \\begin{figure}[ht]\n%   \\centering\n%   \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{./figures/pe_se_example_color.pdf}\n%   \\caption{\\textbf{First Row:} Example graphs with anonymous nodes, \\textit{i.e.}, nodes do not have any distinguishing node features.

Since the 1-WL algorithm produces the same color for all the nodes in both graphs, MPNNs will generate similar node colors. See the colors generated by 1-WL and MPNN in the second row of Figure~\\ref{fig:pe_se_example:a}. \nHowever, the use of a \\textit{global} PE (eg. Laplacian PE \\cite{dwivedi2020benchmarking}) assigns each node a unique color, as depicted in the third row. Consequently, the feature embeddings of the two graphs which are the hash function outputs of the collection of node colors are different, thus making the task to distinguish the graphs successful.\nSimilarly, the use of a \\textit{local} SE (e.g. diagonals of $m$-steps random walk) allows the coloring of the nodes of the 2 graphs to be different \\cite{dwivedi2022LPE} since it captures the difference of the skip links of the two graphs successfully \\cite{loukas2020graph}. See the fourth row where the local SE based colors are depicted on the nodes. Therefore, either of the specific \\textit{local} SE or \\textit{global} PE can help distinguish the two graphs which cannot be learnt by 1-WL or MPNNs.\n\n\\paragraph{The Decalin molecular graph, Figure \\ref{fig:pe_se_example:b}.}\nIn the Decalin graph,\n% presented in Figure \\ref{fig:pe_se_example:b},\nthe node $a$ is isomorphic to node $b$, and so is the node $c$ to node $d$. A 1-WL coloring of the nodes, and equivalently MPNN, would generate one color for the node $a,b$ and another color for $c,d$, see the second row in Figure \\ref{fig:pe_se_example:b}. If that task is to identify a potential link between the node-sets $(a,d)$ and $(b,d)$, the combination of the node colors of the node-sets will produce the same embedding for the two links, thus making the 1-WL or MPNNs based coloring unsuitable to certain tasks \\cite{zhang2021labeling}.\nA similar observation also follows for the node coloring based on the aforementioned \\textit{local} SE \\cite{dwivedi2022LPE}, which is illustrated in the fourth row in Figure \\ref{fig:pe_se_example:b}. However, using a distance-based \\textit{relative} PE on the edges or an eigenvector-based \\textit{global} PE would successfully differentiate the embeddings of the two links.\nTherefore, the \\textit{relative} PE or the \\textit{global} PE which can help to distinguish between the two links cannot be learnt by 1-WL or MPNNs.\n\n% It henceforth justifies the theoretical need to encode PE and SE at any or all of the 3 levels discussed to make the MPNN strictly powerful than 1-WL.\n\nWe can then conclude the following statement based on the above discussion which provides a theoretical basis for the need of PE and SE, as the PE and SE can be directly supplying essential information for the task:\n\n\\textbf{Proposition 1.} \\textit{Assuming no modification applied to MPNNs for a learning task, there exists Positional Encodings (PE) and Structural Encoding (SE) which MPNNs are not guaranteed to learn.}\n\n\\newpage\n"

Let's assume that $h_u$ is unique and countable for every node $u$, which can be accomplised using all the Laplacian eigenvectors as PE. Then, there exist a function $f$ such that an encoding $\\mu_{uv}$ that respects the following characteristics is propagated to the nodes: (i) unique for the triplet $\\{h_u, h_v, e_{uv}\\}$, (ii) invariant to the permutation of $u$ and $v$, (iii) contains the information of $e_{ij}$, (iv) all information of $\\mu_{uv}$ is preserved after the $\\sum$.\n\nHence, an Attention layer that follows the message-passing is able to infer whether two nodes are connected since both nodes will contain the unique identifier $\\mu_{uv}$, and will also be able to infer the edge features from it.\n\nAn example of such function $\\mu_{uv}$ is the tensor product $\\otimes$ of a one-hot encoding unique for each edge $o_{uv}$ and the edge features $e_{uv}$. For example, if $e_{uv} = [e_1, e_2, e_3]$ and the edge is represented with $o_{uv} = [0, 1, 0, 0]$, then $\\mu_{uv} = o_{uv} \\otimes e_{uv} = [0, 0, 0, e_1, e_2, e_3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,0]$ satisfies all the above conditions. Although this function requires an exponential increase in the hidden dimension, this is also the case for the Lemma 5 in \\citet{xu2018how}.\n\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\clearpage\n"

Additionally, we conducted GPS ablation studies on PascalVOC-SP and Peptides-func datasets in the same fashion as presented for 4 other datasets in Appendix~\\ref{app:exp_ablations}. These ablation studies are shown in the Tables~\\ref{tab:abl_pascal}~and~\\ref{tab:abl_peptidesfunc}, respectively.\n\n% \\begin{table}[!ht]\n% \\caption{Test performance on long-range graph benchmarks (LRGB)~\\cite{dwivedi2022LRGB}.

Local MPNN encodes real edge features into the node-level hidden representations, while global attention mechanism can implicitly make use of this information together with PE/SE to infer relation between two nodes without explicit edge features. After each functional block (an MPNN layer, a global attention layer, an MLP) we apply residual connections followed by batch normalization (BN)~\\cite{ioffe2015batchnorm}. In the 2-layer MLP block we use ReLU activations and its inner hidden dimension is twice the layer-input feature dimensionality $d_\\ell$.
