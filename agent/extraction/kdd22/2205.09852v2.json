                "content": "\n \nMechanical ventilation is one of the most widely used interventions in admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU). Around 40\\% of patients in the ICU are supported on invasive mechanical ventilation at any given time, accounting for 12\\% of total hospital costs in the United States \\cite{ambrosino2010difficult,wunsch2013icu}. \nDespite intense efforts in basic and clinical research, an individualized ventilation strategy for critically ill patients remains a major challenge \\cite{mechnical_ventilation,mechnical_ventilation_prasad}.\nIf not applied adequately, suboptimal ventilator settings can result in ventilator-induced lung injury, hemodynamic instability, and toxic effects of oxygen. Dynamic treatment regime (DTR) learning on electronic health records (EHR) with reinforcement learning (RL) might be helpful for learning optimal treatments by analyzing a myriad of (mostly suboptimal) treatment decisions. \n\nRecently, DTR learning with RL has attracted the interest of healthcare researchers \\cite{aiclinician,raghu2017deep,raghu2019reinforcement,ciq,cirl,amia2018,mechnical_ventilation}. However, most existing studies suffer from three limitations. First, most existing RL-based methods \\cite{aiclinician,kdd2018,amia2018,mechnical_ventilation} punish the treatment actions for patients who ultimately suffer from mortality. However, for some patients with worse health states, the mortality rates remain high even if they received optimal treatment. Actions that did not contribute to mortality should not be punished in the treatment of non-survivors. Second, RL strategies learned from initial EHR datasets may be biased due to the existence of confounders (patients' health states are confounders for treatment actions and clinical outcomes) and data unbalance (mortality rates in different datasets vary widely and might be less than 25\\%). Third, external validation on different-source data is lacking (e.g., how a model trained on data extracted from the United States performs on European datasets). Especially when the treatment action distributions are different, efficient adaptation to new datasets has not been considered.\n% \\textcolor{blue}{It is very good to talk on the introduction. But NOT in the abstract.}\n\n\nIn this study, we propose a new deconfounding actor-critic model (\\textbf{DAC}) to address these issues.\nFirst, we resample paired survivor and non-survivor patients with similar estimated mortality risks to build balanced mini-batches.\nThen we adopt an actor-critic model to learn the optimal DTR policies. The longitudinal patients' data are sent to a long short-term memory network (LSTM) \\cite{lstm} to generate the health state sequences.\nThe actor network produces the probabilities of different treatment actions at next time step and is trained by maximizing the rewards generated by the critic network. To avoid punishing some effective treatment actions in EHR history of non-survivors, the critic network produces both short-term and long-term rewards. Short-term rewards can encourage the treatment actions that improve patients' health states at coming time steps, even if the patients ultimately suffer from mortality.\nTo further remove the confounding bias, we introduce a dynamic inverse probability of treatment weighting method to assign weights to the rewards at each time step for each patient and train the actor network with the weighted rewards.\nFinally, we introduce a policy adaptation method to transfer well-learned models to new-source small-scale datasets. The policy adaption method chooses actions so that the resulting next-state distribution on the target environment is similar to the next-state distribution resulting from the recommended action on the source environment.\n\n\nWe conduct DTR learning experiments on a semi-synthetic dataset and two real-world datasets (i.e., MIMIC-III \\cite{mimic} and AmsterdamUMCdb \\cite{amsterdamumcdb}). The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines and can reduce the estimated mortality rates. Moreover, we find the mortality rates are lowest in patients for whom clinicians’ actual treatment actions matched the model's decisions.\n The proposed model can provide individualized treatment decisions that could improve patients' clinical outcomes.\n% Moreover, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed deconfounding method, we conducted treatment effect estimation experiments on semi-synthetic datasets and compared the proposed methods with state-of-the-art models. Due to limited space, we put the treatment effect estimation results in the supplementary material.\n\nIn sum, our contributions are as follows: (i) We develop a new DTR learning framework with RL and experiments on MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model; (ii) We present a patient resampling operation and a confounding balance module to alleviate the confounding bias; (iii) We propose combining long-term and short-term rewards to train the RL models; (iv) We propose a policy adaptation model that can effectively adapt pre-trained models to new small-scale datasets.  The code of our proposed DAC model can be found at GitHub\\footnote{\\label{github}\\url{https://github.com/yinchangchang/DAC}}. \n\n\n% The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  In Section 2, we describe technical details of the proposed dynamic treatment regime learning framework. In Section 3, we conduct experiments on two real-world EHR datasets. We review the related studies in Section 4. Section 5 concludes our work.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                "content": "\n\\textbf{Setup.}\nDTR is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) with finite time steps and a deterministic policy consisting of an action space $\\mathcal{A}$, a hidden state space $\\mathcal{S}$, a observational state space $\\mathcal{O}$, and a reward function: $\\mathcal{A} \\times \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow R$. \nA patient's EHR data consists of a sequence of observational variables (including demographics, vital signs and lab values), denoted by $O=\\{o_1, o_2, ..., o_T\\}$, $o_t \\in \\mathcal{O}$, the treatment actions represented as $A=\\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_T\\}$, $a_t \\in \\mathcal{A}$ and mortality outcome $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where $T$ denotes the length of the patient's EHR history.\nWe assume some hidden variables $S=\\{s_1, s_2, ..., s_T\\}$, $s_t \\in \\mathcal{S}$ can represent the health states of a patient and include the key information of previous observational data of the patients. \nGiven the previous hidden state sequence $S_t = \\{s_1, s_2, ..., s_t\\}$, action sequence $A_{t-1} = \\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_{t-1}\\}$ and observation sequence $O_t = \\{o_1, o_2, ..., o_t\\}$ up to time step $t$, our goal is to learn a policy $\\pi_\\theta(\\cdot|S_t, O_t, A_{t-1})$ to select the optimal action $\\hat{a}_t$ by maximizing the the sum of discounted rewards (return) from time step $t$. We use LSTM to model patient health states and  LSTM can remember the key information of patients' EHR history. We assume state $s_t$ contains the key information of the previous data, and learn a policy $\\pi_\\theta(\\cdot|s_t)$ instead of $\\pi_\\theta(\\cdot|S_t, O_t, A_{t-1})$.\n\n\\vspace{5pt}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Time-varying confounders.}\nFigure \\ref{fig:model} (a) shows the causal relationship of various variables.  $o_t$ denotes the time-dependent covariates of the observational data at time step $t$, which is only affected by hidden state $s_t$. The treatment actions $a_t$ are affected by both observed variable $o_t$ and hidden state $s_t$. The potential outcomes $y$ are affected by last observational variable $o_T$, treatment assignments $a_T$ and hidden state $s_T$. Patients' health states $S$ are time-varying confounders for both treatment actions $A$ and clinical outcomes $y$. Without the consideration of the causal relationship among the variables, it is possible that RL models may focus on the strong correlation between positive outcomes and \"safe\" actions (e.g., without mechanical ventilator) and prefer to recommend the \"safe\" actions, which will cause much higher mortality rates for high-risk patients. It is very important to remove the confounding when training DTR policies on real-world datasets. \nDTR policies learned from initial clinical data could be biased due to the existence of time-varying confounders. \n\n\nWe summarize the important notations in this paper in Table \\ref{tab:notations}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

First, the training of RL models is usually guided by designed rewards, which are highly related to patients' long-term outcomes. Existing DTR models \\cite{aiclinician,kdd2018,raghu2017deep} encourage the treatment actions that survivors received and punish the treatment actions that non-survivors received. The mortality rates of the collected datasets have important effects on the learned policies and might cause policy bias. The mortality rates of different-source datasets vary widely and the bias could further limit the model performance when adapting learned DTR policies to new-source datasets. The second reason for policy bias is the existence of confounders. Patients' clinical outcomes $y$ (e.g., mortality or discharged) are affected by both patient health states $s_t$ and treatment actions $o_t$, as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:model} (a). The treatment actions are also affected by patient health states $s_t$. The patient hidden states $s_{t}$ are confounders for both actions $a_{t}$ and final clinical outcome $y$. \nIn this subsection, we introduce patient resampling module and confounding balance module to address the policy bias problems.\n\n% Action distributions between the case pool (patients suffered from mortality) and the control pool (patients discharged) are different. As shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:distribution}, the percentages of high-dose vasopressors in the EHRs of patients with mortality are more than two times of the percentages of high-dose vasopressors in the EHRs of discharged patients.\n% Existing models learn treatment strategies from initial-distribution data, which makes it possible to learn a biased treatment policy (e.g., a policy that always recommends low-dose vasopressors might significantly increase the mortality risks of patients with higher severity of illness).\n\n\\vspace{5pt}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Patient resampling module.} \nWe resample the patients according to their mortality risks when training our treatment learning models. First, we train a mortality risk prediction model, which takes the patients' observational data as inputs and produces the 90-day mortality probability at each time step $t$.\nThen, patients are divided into a survivor pool and a non-survivor pool. When training treatment learning models, we always sample paired patients from the two pools respectively with similar maximal mortality risks in their EHR sequence. With the resampling operation, we build balanced mini-batch where survivors and non-survivors have similar mortality risk distributions, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:model} (b).\n\n\\vspace{5pt}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Confounding balance module.}\nTo adjust the confounder, we train the actor-critic network with weighted rewards and the weights are computed based on the probabilities that the corresponding treatment actions are assigned. Given a patient health state $s_t$ at time step $t$, the probability that an action $a$ would be assigned is represented as $\\pi_\\theta(a|s_t)$. We compute the weights using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) \\cite{iptw,iptwm} and extend to dynamic multi-action setting as follows,  \n\\begin{equation} \n\\label{eq:weight}\nw_t = \\Pi^t_{\\tau=1} \\frac{f(a_\\tau|A_{\\tau - 1})}{f(a_\\tau|A_{\\tau-1},O_{\\tau -1})}\n=\\Pi^t_{\\tau=1} \\frac{f(a_\\tau|A_{\\tau - 1})}{\\pi^c(a_\\tau|s_\\tau)}\n%\\sum_i \\frac{I(a_t = a_i)*P(a_t|a_{t-1})}{\\pi^c(a_i|a_{t-1},s_t)},\n% p(a_0, a_1, ..., a_t) / p(a_0, ..., a_t, s_t) =\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $f(a_\\tau|A_{\\tau - 1})$ is the posterior probability of action $a_\\tau$ given last action sequence $A_{\\tau - 1}$, which could be modelled with LSTM. $f(a_\\tau|A_{\\tau-1},O_{\\tau})$ denotes predicted probability of receiving treatment $a_\\tau$\ngiven the observed data and historical information, and is computed with clinician policy $\\pi^c$. $\\pi^c(a_\\tau|s_\\tau)$ is the probability for action $a_\\tau$ given patient's health state $s_\\tau$. $\\pi^c$ shares the same actor network as the proposed DAC model and is trained by mimicking clinicians' policy.\nThe computed weights are used in the training of the actor network.\n\n\n"

Existing models usually impute the missing values based on previous observational data. However, for some patients with some high missing-rate variables, the imputation results might be inaccurate and thus introduce more imputation bias, which is harmful for modeling the patient health states. Following \\cite{tame}, we embed the observed variables with corresponding values, and only input the embeddings of observed variables to the model. Given the variable $i$  and the observed values in the whole dataset, we sort the values and discretize the values into $V$ sub-ranges with equal number of observed values in each sub-range. The variable $i$ is embedded into a vector $e^i \\in R^k$ with an embedding layer. As for the sub-range $v (1 \\leq v \\leq V)$, we embed it into a vector $e'^v \\in R^{2k}$: \n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\begin{equation} \n\\label{eq:value-embedding-1} \ne'^v_j = sin(\\frac{v*j}{V*k}), \\qquad\ne'^v_{k+j} = cos(\\frac{v*j}{V*k}), \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $0 \\leq j < k$.

Given a patient with EHR length equal to $T$, $R^m(s_t, a_t) = 0, t<T$. Following \\cite{aiclinician,raghu2019reinforcement}, the reward for the last action is set as $\\pm 15$. Specially, if the patient suffers from mortality, $R^m(s_T, a_T) = -15$. Otherwise, $R^m(s_T, a_T) = 15$.\n\nMost existing RL-based models are trained with long-term rewards and punish the actions non-survivors received. However, for some patients with worse health states, the probability of mortality is still high even if they receive optimal treatment. Some actions should not be punished in the treatment of patients with mortality. We propose a short-term reward based on estimated mortality risk to improve the training of RL models. The estimated mortality risks $p_m(s_t)$ are generated with fully connected layers and a Sigmoid layer:\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:mortality-risk-prediction}\np_m(s_t) = Sigmoid (s_t w_m + b_m),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $w_m \\in R^{k \\times |\\mathcal{A}|}$, $b_m \\in R^{|\\mathcal{A}|}$ are learnable parameters.\nThe mortality probability with an action $a$ at time $t$ is the action's corresponding dimension of $p_m(s_t)$, denoted as $p_m(s_t, a)$. The mortality risk prediction function $p_m$ is trained by minimizing $J(w_m, b_m)$:\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:mortality-risk-prediction-loss}\nJ(w_m, b_m) = E_{s_t \\sim \\rho} [-y\\log (p_m(s_t, a_t)) - (1-y) \\log (1 - p_m(s_t, a_t))]\n\\end{equation}\nThe short-term reward is computed as the mortality probability decrease given the action as follows, \n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:short-reward}\nR^s(s_t, a_t) = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\pi_\\theta(a|s_t) p_m(s_t, a) - p_m(s_t, a_t)\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe overall reward $Q$ is computed by combining short-term and long-term reward:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:weighted-reward}\nQ(s_t,a_t) = w_t ( \\alpha R^l(s_t,a_t) +  (1-\\alpha)R^s(s_t,a_t)),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a hyper-parameter to adjust the weights of the two rewards and $w_t$ denotes the inverse weight computed by the confounding balance module.

The four Imitation Learning versions share the same framework with LSTM to model patient states and two fully connected layers to produce the probability distributions of next actions.\nNote that the extracted variables contain lots of vital signs and lab values, which have lots of missing values. The baselines can only take fixed-sized observed variables as inputs. Following \\cite{aiclinician,raghu2019reinforcement}, we impute the missing values with multi-variable nearest-neighbor imputation~\\cite{imputation} before training the baseline models.\n\n\n\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Implementation details.} \nWe implement our proposed model with Python 2.7.15 and PyTorch 1.3.0. For training models, we use Adam optimizer with a mini-batch of 256 patients. The observed variables and corresponding values are projected into a $512$-d space. The models are trained on 1 GPU (TITAN RTX 6000), with a learning rate of 0.0001. We randomly divide the datasets into 10 sets. All the experiment results are averaged from 10-fold cross validation, in which 7 sets were used for training every time, 1 set for validation and 2 sets for test. The validation sets are used to determine the best values of parameters in the training iterations. \nMore details and implementation code are available in GitHub\\textsuperscript{\\ref{github}}.\n\nNote that there are $7 \\times 7 \\times 7=343$ kinds of actions three parameters (i.e., PEEP, FiO2 and tidal volume). At the beginning of training phase, it might be inaccurate to compute the probabilities of 343 kinds of actions, which would cause the computed weight in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:weight}) to be unstable. \nMoreover, clinical guidelines \\cite{guideline_fan2017official,guideline_lahouti} also recommend clinicians to increase or decrease the parameters according to patients' health states. When computing the inverse probabilities, we use the probabilities for 3 action changes (i.e., increase, decrease or keep the same for each parameter) instead of the probabilities of 7 actions. \n\n\n\n\n"

The results show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines. \nThe RL-based models (e.g., AI Clinician, MoE, SRL-RNN) achieve lower estimated mortality rates and higher WIS and action accuracy rates than supervised models (i.e., Imitation Learning and MDP), which demonstrates the effectiveness of RL in DTR learning tasks.\n\n\nAmong the three versions of imitation learning,  Imitation Learning $^M$ is trained on the non-survivor patients and thus performs worse than the other two versions. However, Imitation Learning $^M$ still achieves comparable performance to MDP trained on discharged patients, which demonstrates the clinicians' treatment strategies for survivors and non-survivors are similar. Thus it is not appropriate to directly punish the treatment actions prescribed to patients with mortality. We speculate that for some non-survivors, the treatment actions might be helpful but the confounder (e.g., the poor health states before treatments) caused the 90-day mortality. Thus we propose deconfounding modules to alleviate the patient state distribution bias.\nTaking into account the confounders, CIQ, CIRL and the proposed models outperform the RL baselines, which demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporation of counterfactual reasoning in DTR learning tasks. Among the models with the consideration of confounders, the proposed DAC performs better than CIQ and CIRL. We speculate the reasons are two-fold: (i) we train DAC on balanced mini-batch by resampling the patients, which makes critic network's counterfactual action reward estimation more accurate; (ii) the proposed short-term rewards are more efficient at capturing short-term patients' health state changes than discounted long-term rewards during the training of RL models. \n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the five versions of the proposed model, the main version (i.e., DAC) outperforms DAC$^{-rsp}$ and DAC$^{-dcf}$, which demonstrates the effectiveness of proposed patient resampling and confounding balance modules. Combining short-term and long-term rewards, DAC outperforms DAC$^{-short}$ and DAC$^{-long}$, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the two designed rewards. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\\vspace{5pt}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Distribution of Actions}: Visualization of the action distribution in the 3-D action space on MIMIC-III are shown in Figure \\ref{fig:distribution_mimic}. The results show that our model learned similar policies to clinicians on MIMIC-III dataset. DAC suggests more actions with the higher PEEP and FiO2. Besides, the learning policies recommend more frequent lower tidal volume compared to clinician policy.\n\n\n\n\n% \\vspace{5pt}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Comparison of Clinician and DAC policies}: \nWe find that the mortality rates are lowest in patients for whom clinicians’ actual treatments matched the actions the learned policies recommend. Figure~\\ref{fig:dose_diff_mimic} shows the relations between mortality rate and mechanical ventilation setting difference on MIMIC-III. The results show when patients received lower values of FiO2, PEEP and Tidal Volume, the mortality rates increase much faster. We speculate the reasons are two-fold: (i) DAC only recommends high values of FiO2, PEEP and Tidal volume to the high-risk patients, who still have relatively higher mortality rates even with optimal treatments; (ii) the high-risk patients received low-value settings, which further increased their mortality rates.\n\n\n\n\\vspace{5pt}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Policy adaptation}: We adapt the model trained on MIMIC-III to AmsterdamUMCdb, and Fig. \\ref{fig:transfer} shows the estimated mortality and WIS with different training sizes on AmsterdamUMCdb. DAC-M is trained on MIMIC-III and directly validated on AmsterdamUMCdb. DAC-A is trained on AmsterdamUMCdb and DACPA is pretrained on MIMIC-III and then adapted to AmsterdamUMCdb. The results show that with transfer learning on AmsterdamUMCdb, DACPA outperforms DAC-M, which demonstrates that the policy adaption is very helpful and improved model performance. When training size becomes smaller, the performance gaps between DACPA and DAC-A are larger, which demonstrates that the introduced policy adaption method is useful when adapting trained models to new-source small-scale datasets. \n \n\n\n \n \n\n"

From a conceptual point of view, the studies most closely related to ours are \\cite{ciq,cirl} and we compare the proposed DAC with them. Both two studies incorporate causal inference into RL models. The key difference between ours and theirs are: (i) we resample the patients and the training DAC with balanced mini-batch can improve the model performance; (ii) we design a short-term reward that can further remove the confounding;\n(iii) our model is based on actor-critic framework and the critic network can provide more accurate rewards with the help of the patient resampling module and short-term reward;\n(iv) we introduce a policy adaptation method to the proposed DAC, which can efficiently adapt trained models to new-source environments.\n\n\n\n"

Based on these\nresults, the estimated mortality rates corresponding to the predicted mortality rate of different policies are used as the measurements to denote the estimated in-hospital mortality. Although the estimated mortality does not equal the mortality in the real-world clinical setting, it is a universal metric currently for computational testing. The relations between estimated mortality rate and predicted mortality probability are shown in Figure \\ref{fig:predicted_mortality}. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Weighted importance sampling(WIS)}: Following \\cite{aiclinician,raghu2017deep}, we also implement  a high-confidence off-policy evaluation (HCOPE) method (WIS). The human clinician policy is defined as $\\pi_0$, and $\\pi_1$ denotes the learned AI policy. We defined $\\rho_t = \\pi_1(a_t, s_t)/\\pi_0(a_t,s_t)$ as the per-step importance ratio, where $(a_t, s_t)$ represent the $t^{th}$ actual (action, state) pair for a patient. $\\rho_{1:t} = \\pi_{t'=1}^t \\rho_{t'}$ is the cumulative importance ratio up to step $t$ and $w_t = \\sum_{i=1}^{|D|} \\rho_{1:t}^{(i)}/ |D|$ denotes the average cumulative importance ratio at horizon $t$ in dataset $D$ and $|D|$ as the number of trajectories in $D$. The trajectory-wise WIS estimator is given by:\n\\vspace{-4mm} \n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:vwis} \nV_{WIS} = \\frac{\\rho_{1:H}}{w_H}(\\sum_{t=1}^H \\gamma^{t-1}R_t),\n\\vspace{-1mm}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $H$ denotes the length of steps for the patient and $R_t$ denote the long-term reward. \n% Following \\cite{aiclinician,raghu2017deep}, if a patient suffers from mortality in 90 days, the reward for the last action is set as -15. Otherwise, the reward for the last action is set as 15. \nThen, the WIS estimator is the average estimate over all trajectories, namely:\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:wis} \nWIS = \\frac{1}{|D|}\\sum_{i=1}^{|D|} V_{WIS}^{(i)},\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\end{equation} \nwhere $V_{WIS}^{(i)}$ is WIS applied to the trajectory for $i^{th}$ patient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Action accuracy rate}: \nFollowing \\cite{cirl,ciq}, we compute the optimal action accuracy rate to evaluate the models' performance to learn optimal DTR policies in simulated environments.\nMechanical ventilator has three important parameters: PEEP, Vt and FiO2. We compute two kinds of accuracy rates: \\textbf{ACC-3} (whether the three parameters are set the same as the optimal action simultaneously) and \\textbf{ACC-1} (whether each parameter is set correctly).  The metrics are computed as follows:\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\label{eq:acc-3} \nACC-3 = \\frac{1}{|D|}\\sum_{i=1}^{|D|} \\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^T f(a_t^p, \\hat{a}_t^p) * f(a_t^v, \\hat{a}_t^v) * f(a_t^f, \\hat{a}_t^f),\n\\end{equation*} \n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:acc-1} \nACC-1 = \\frac{1}{|D|}\\sum_{i=1}^{|D|} \\frac{1}{T*3}\\sum_{t=1}^T f(a_t^p, \\hat{a}_t^p) + f(a_t^v, \\hat{a}_t^v) + f(a_t^f, \\hat{a}_t^f),\n\\end{equation} \n$$f(a,b)=\n\\begin{cases}\n1& \\text{if }a = b\\\\\n0& \\text{else }\n\\end{cases},$$ \nwhere $a_t^p$, $a_t^v$, $a_t^f$ are recommened actions for PEEP, Vt and FiO2, $\\hat{a}_t^p$, $\\hat{a}_t^v$, $\\hat{a}_t^f$ are optimal actions. \n\n"

The results show that our model has a more clear negative correlation between expected returns and mortality rates than DQN in both MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb datasets. The reason might be two-fold: (i) DQN is trained on the initial EHR data with confounder bias; (ii) DQN punishes the actions used for patients who suffer from mortality, while some actions might be optimal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Distribution of Actions}: \nVisualization of the action distribution in the 3-dimensional action space on AmsterdamUMCdb are shown in Figure \\ref{fig:distribution_ast}. The results show that the proposed model learned similar policies to clinicians. DAC suggests more actions with the lowest and highest PEEP and FiO2. Besides, the learning policies recommend more frequent lower tidal volume compared to clinician policy.\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Comparison of Clinician and DAC policies}:\nWe find that the mortality rates are lowest in patients for whom clinicians’ actual treatments matched the actions the learned policies recommend both on MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb datasets. \nFigure~\\ref{fig:dose_diff_ast} shows the relations between mortality rate and mechanical ventilation setting difference on AmsterdamUMCdb.\n\n\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Hyper-parameter optimization}: \nFigure \\ref{fig:para} shows the optimization of parameter $\\alpha$ on MIMIC-III dataset. We find the model performance is not sensitive when $0.05 \\leq \\alpha \\le 0.2$. We set $\\alpha=0.1$ when training the DAC model. Because the long-term rewards' value range (i.e., from -15 to +15)  is wider than short-term rewards' value range (i.e., from -1 to +1), the weight of long-term reward is smaller than the weight of short-term reward.\n\n\n\n\n"
