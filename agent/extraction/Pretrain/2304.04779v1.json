        "abstract": "Graph self-supervised learning (SSL), including contrastive and generative\napproaches, offers great potential to address the fundamental challenge of\nlabel scarcity in real-world graph data. Among both sets of graph SSL\ntechniques, the masked graph autoencoders (e.g., GraphMAE)--one type of\ngenerative method--have recently produced promising results. The idea behind\nthis is to reconstruct the node features (or structures)--that are randomly\nmasked from the input--with the autoencoder architecture. However, the\nperformance of masked feature reconstruction naturally relies on the\ndiscriminability of the input features and is usually vulnerable to disturbance\nin the features. In this paper, we present a masked self-supervised learning\nframework GraphMAE2 with the goal of overcoming this issue. The idea is to\nimpose regularization on feature reconstruction for graph SSL. Specifically, we\ndesign the strategies of multi-view random re-mask decoding and latent\nrepresentation prediction to regularize the feature reconstruction. The\nmulti-view random re-mask decoding is to introduce randomness into\nreconstruction in the feature space, while the latent representation prediction\nis to enforce the reconstruction in the embedding space. Extensive experiments\nshow that GraphMAE2 can consistently generate top results on various public\ndatasets, including at least 2.45% improvements over state-of-the-art baselines\non ogbn-Papers100M with 111M nodes and 1.6B edges.",
